### Introduction
Lucidity is an experimental React application that allows users to document their dreams and track sleeping patterns with statistical data with the intention of helping users become lucid dreamers. *(A lucid dream is a dream during which the dreamer is aware of dreaming. During this event, the dreamer may be able to exert some degree of control over the characters, narrative, and environment.)*

### How it Works
The key to lucid dreaming is to consistently document one's dreams so that patterns are easily recognized while dreaming. Lucidity provides users with a quick and simple interface that helps them keep track of what they're dreaming about and provides interactive charts and personalized statistics to help measure progress.
